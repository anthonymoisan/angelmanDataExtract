# Angelman topic
Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neurogenetic disorder that affects about one in 15,000 people, or approximately 500,000 individuals worldwide. People living with AS have a genetic difference on chromosome 15. People with these chromosomal changes do not produce any, or remotely enough, of something called UBE3Aâ€”which is a protein involved in brain functioning that helps us walk, talk and perform many other everyday tasks.

As a result, children and adults with AS typically have balance issues, motor impairments and can have debilitating seizures. Disruptive sleep is often a serious challenge. Some never walk. Most do not speak. Individuals with AS have a normal life expectancy, but require continuous care and are unable to live independently.

# Goals of the project
We would like to collect public data from various APIs 
And feed a Dashboard in PowerBI in order to have specific KPI about this rare disease.
At the end, we would like that the scrapers would run automatically and the Dashboard would be refreshed one time per day. The routines are hosted on pythonanywhere.com and the Dashboard on Power BI Services.

# Results
You could find at https://www.fastfrance.org/angelman-bi-dashboard/ the final realization where the Dashboard is embedded in a website. And we hope that this work could help pharma/biotech partners find places with both AS expertise and experience running clinical trials.

# About the repository
- angelman_viz_keys : the repository where we have the token or access information. You could find Config.ini to describe the two config files
- data : the repository where we have an input file in json and the output csv files generated by the different scrapers
- doc : step to deploy the API in pythonanywhere.com and some git commands
- src : the code source

## The scrapers
- scraperPubMed in interaction with PubMed (https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) in order to show number of scientific publications per year
- scraperASTrial and scraperASFClinicalTrial in interaction with ClinicalTrials (https://clinicaltrials.gov)  in order to show the clinical trials for this disease and the number of trials hosted by ASF clinics
- scraperPopution in interaction with UnPopulation (https://population.un.org) in order to have statistics about country in the world
For each scraper, you could execute with a main and have the results.csv in the repository data

## The endpoints
- test.py in order to try the different scrapers
- appFlask.py : an API Rest with Flask in order to expose the different methods to be called by Power BI Dashboard
- appFlaskMySQL.py : an API Rest with Flask in order to expose the different methods to be called by Power BI Dashboard but we have a buffer with a MySQLDatabase
- databaseSQL.py : schedule this task to run automatically in PythonAnyWhere in order to launch the different scrapers and store the results in the MySQL database
You can execute the two API flask remotely (you need to have an account in PythonAnyWhere) but you can try locally the code

## The two solutions and what is the best one between appFlask and appFlaskMySQL ?

1) appFlask

   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1e26497-0da1-4f02-83d8-d09732d233ab)

The first solution is an API flask where the Dashboard call the different scrapers.
The main issue is that we could have timeout issues if the process of the scraper is heavy.

2) appFlaskMySQL

The second solution is the best with a task that run automatically to execute the different scrapers and to store the results in MySQL database. The Dashboard only interact with the database MySQL and we don't have with this solution our timeout issue.

## SQLScript
For the solution with MySQL database, we have some script in order to create the different tables
